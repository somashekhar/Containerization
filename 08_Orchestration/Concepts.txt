Cluster Nodes:
    OS
    CE
    Agent and API
    Shared store 
        1. external node and API is made to connect to
        2. On node
        3. replica is kept on all nodes (no more used)

Application:
    Manifest file
        when user submits the manifest to api server, api dumps it to shared storage.
    Scheduler
        through api it looks into shared store and write back decisions into the shared store.
    Agent pulls this decisions from share storage and run the services.    

    When a application fails on a node then,
    1. Agent will send this update to api server. Agent can take a call to restart it.
    2. Agent will send update and leave.
    
    When node is down then a component will get to know and write it into shared store.
    Scheduler will wait for certain time and then writes a info that node is down and updates the apt config to stop running apps.
    Also writes decision to run the apps on new nodes.
