# Docker Storage
docker system df
docker container diff <container name>
    A   Added
    C   Changed
    D   Deleted
Note: Above command shows the files change at container storage.

Container storage is created at start of container.
If container does not write anything then it takes 0 size.
The moment container is deleted (not stopped) the container storage is gone permanently.

Docker gives 3 options for mounting an external storage:
    1. Volume mounting
    2. Bind mounting
    3. tmpfs mounting

Volume Mount:    
    A volume object is unit of storage maintained by docker engine.
    docker engine would require "volume drivers" to access this storage, storage can be anywhere.

    Storage technology solutions provide storage and volume drivers along with them.
    "Local" is default volume driver for using host storage.
    "docker system info", plugins will give you details.

    Note:
      docker plugin create 

    We can see the files created under mount path.
    cat /var/lib/docker/volumes/vol1/_data/name.txt

    Volume will created if it does not exists when given creating container.

    Two or more containers can read and write to same volume and files.
    Application needs to take care of this issue.
    docker container create --name v2 -it --mount type=volume,source=vol1,target=/vols/vol1 --mount type=volume,source=vol2,target=/data alpine

    Want to get volumes from another container 
    docker container create --name v3 --volumes-from v2 

    Create volume without name i.e., Anonymus volume. 
    docker container create --name v4 --mount type=volume,target=/newdata alpine

    Want to delete volume Anonymus volumes created by container while deleting docker container ?
    docker container rm --volumes -f v4

    When will be volumes deleted ?
        Anonymus volume will get deleted when container gets deleted using --volumes option. Only those created by it.
        Normal volumes will get deleted when we remove them manually.

    Who creates volume ?
    docker engine through the volume drivers.

    When is volume created ?
    Manually or Container create 

    Note:
      Volumes cannot be deleted until they are used by containers.

Binding Mounting:
    Mounting a path on the host to a path in the container.
    Gives acess to paths of host file system. Do not use it until really required.

    Used when need to access host file system.

    docker container create --name b1 -it --mount type=bind,source=/home/sbidari/docker/bind1,target=/data alpine

tempfs:
    Gives a temperory storage and will not be part of file system.
    Store files until the container is running. Restart container to get new storage.
    Cannot attach this to other containers.
    
    IO related or cache are the usecases.

    docker container create --name b1 -it --mount type=tmpfs,target=/data alpine
    docker container attach b1
