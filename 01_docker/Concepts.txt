# Docker Processes

Deamons are run by linux init processes.
In Container deamonization is not possible since it does not have access to init process.

init -> docker deamon -> docker engine -> docker containers

We can ask the system to start the container when system restarts with a restart policy while creating a container.
    --restart policy
        no              default
        always
        on-failure
        unless-stopped

What if container crashed ?
When always policy choosen then it restarts.
If on-failure choosen then if it fails with an error then it restarts.

What if we stop manually ?
When always policy choosen then it restarts when system restarts.


We can make the container Initiative by,
    1. make it Initiative by specifying at start
    2. Start a new process and command to be executed on run by using docker exec.
        docker container exec -it c0 /bin/sh

Note:
    We cannot use Ctrl + P Ctrl + Q to relogin in 2nd case.
    We can exit from the new process created without stopping the container since it is not init process.

Note:
    We can create container with an entrypoint.
