Linux Container:
    Control Groups [cgroup]
    Namespaces

Container Toolkits:
    - Imctfy
    - docker
    - rkt
    - singularity
    - podman

Docker:
    - Toolkit for managing containerized applications
    - Promoted the view that one container = one application
    - Originally built around lxc 
    - Replaced lxc with their own runtime, libcontainer
    
Standardization and OCI[Open Container Initiative]:
    - Specifies exactly how a container must be started and stopped, inclusing isolation, processes and filesystem.
    - A reference implementation exists, called "runc"
    - Docker uses runc by default now
    - Other implementations also exists
    - As long as any other containerization follows OCI standard we can configure docker to use it
    

Important Contributions of Docker:
    - Docker Imgage format
    - Docker Registry Protocol
    - Docker Engine

  Note:
    Docker host: Machine on which docker engine runs. Docker Engine does all operations on it through docker rest API.
    
Docker Engine:
    - A deamon or service
    - Exposes a Rest API
    - Manages all aspects of containerization
    - Depends on lower-level tools for actually running containers:
        - containerd
        - runc
    - Comes with a command line client to perform standard operations
    - 64-bit only
    
Docker Images:
    - Packaging format for applications
    - Are blueprints for creating containers
    - Contain data and metadata
    - Stored in layers

Understanding Image layers:
    - Downloading of duplicate images is not done.
    - File system of a container is dynamically generated at runtime.    

  Golden Rule:
    1. Images are immutable. So we create writable layer for a container. [container storage]
    2. Containers are disposable.

Image names or "tags":
    - A single image, uniquely identified by a UUID or a hash, can have multiple names or "tags"
    - Formally, image names have up to four parts:
        [<registry>][<account>]<repository>[:<tag>]
        Eg: docker.io/library/alphine:3.11
            by default below values are assumed:
                docker.io
                library
                latest

commands:
    whoami  
    hostname
    ps aux
